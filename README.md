## 🧠 About Me

Hey, I’m a 20-year-old backend engineer from Germany. I got into coding in 2019 because I was curious about how big applications actually work behind the scenes. Spoiler alert: I got hooked. Now I can't stop thinking about how systems scale, recover, and avoid crashing at the worst possible time. I really enjoy diving into the gritty parts of distributed systems. I want to build systems that rely on resilience instead of luck, and correctness instead of guesswork. Long-term, I want to help build infrastructure that actually supports developers, scales smoothly, and solves more problems than it creates.

When I’m not writing code, I’m usually lifting weights or hanging out with friends.

## ⚙️ Interests

- ⚡ Distributed systems & infrastructure engineering
- 📡 Real-time systems (gateways, routing, bidirectional streaming / communication via gRPC)
- 🌐 Networking (veth pairs, bridges, tunnels, that kind of thing)
- 🔧 Service orchestration (scheduling, health checks, zero-downtime deploys)
- 📦 Container runtimes (learning how containers actually work under the hood)
- 🧪 Observability (metrics, logs, traces — making systems understandable)

## 🧪 Current Projects

### [ServerStats](https://serverstatsbot.com) — Discord analytics bot  
Tracking **1 M+ live counters** across **3 M+ servers**, ServerStats turns raw Discord data into eye‑catching channel counters.

_This is a hobby project, so I hack on whatever’s fun and helps the community._
